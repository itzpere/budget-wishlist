# WishtoBudget

A self-hosted wishlist and budget management tool that helps you answer "Can I afford this?" at a glance. Organize purchases across multiple wishlists, set spending limits, and visualize affordability with battery-style indicators that show which items fit your budget.

**For privacy-conscious individuals** who want control over their financial data while managing personal purchases, savings goals, and wish lists across different categories (tech, home, gifts, etc.).

**What makes it different:** Interactive purchase simulation mode lets you select items and see real-time budget impact before committing, plus unique battery visualization that instantly shows whether items are affordable.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multiple Wishlists with Budgets** - Create unlimited wishlists (Tech, Home, Gifts, etc.) each with individual budget limits and track combined total budget
- **Battery-Style Visual Tracking** - Items display as "battery" cards showing charge level based on available budget (green when affordable, red when over budget)
- **Purchase Simulation Mode** - Interactive "what-if" mode to select items and see real-time budget impact before committing to purchases
- **Flexible Pricing** - Support for fixed prices or price ranges (min/max) with additional costs (shipping, taxes) and configurable simulation modes
- **Complete Activity History** - Full audit trail of budget changes, item additions, purchases, and updates with timestamps
- **Custom Item Icons** - Upload custom images or provide URLs for items with automatic local caching
- **Database Import/Export** - Full backup and restore functionality via JSON export for data portability
